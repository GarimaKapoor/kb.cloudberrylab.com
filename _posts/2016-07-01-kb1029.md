## Problem

CloudBerry Backup for [Linux][1f46d3be] comes with [command line interface][4ac3b676] (CLI) what allows customer to configure file level backup for Linux content (i.e. files & directories). CLI is very powerful tool operate entire backup ecosystem (i.e. configure account, configure license, create plans, manage plans, - actually all what is possible through regular GUI of CloudBerry Lab for Linux with Graphic interface). [Managed backup][f239e3e0] edition (the one which you obtain from MBS) needs to be linked to certain user first and then - activated. So if you missed the fist step and trying to activate your license you are going to see the following error message:

![Error: License not verified! Product can't backup now](/images/error_License_not_verified_product_cant_backup_now.png)

## Resolution

In order to resolve the issue you need to go through the following steps:

*  Linked your copy of downloaded (from MBS) to existing user;
*  Activate either commercial or trial license.

{% highlight Bash shell scripts %}
$ cbb addAccount -e your.email@domain.com -p Password -ssl yes|no
{% endhighlight %}

This will link your software to appropriate account in MBS. Next step is to activate license.

If you have commercial license (recently purchased or want to reused released license):

{% highlight Bash shell scripts %}
$ cbb activateLicense -e your.email@domain.com -k <license_key>
{% endhighlight %}

or request 15 days trial:

{% highlight Bash shell scripts %}
cbb activateLicense -e your.email@domain.com -t
{% endhighlight %}
