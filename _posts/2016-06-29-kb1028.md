## Article

CloudBerry Backup for Mac OS X helps customers to backup folders and files to object storage like AWS S3, Microsoft Azure etc. It is quite stable and mature product, however sometimes you may meet small glitches or operation issues. The best way to get such situations resolved is to submit support case. In order to receive quick, competent and consistent reply it is good practice to supply such request with all available information (logs, configuration files).

### GUI information

The best and easiest way to liaise with technical consultants from CloudBerry Lab (Architects or Support) is to submit and send with short description logs from GUI. In the interface of the product locate Settings &rarr; Diagnostic as per below picture.

We suggest the following approach (to simplify and better escalation):

*  User Name should be valid and we should be able to find it in our system (use your registration name);
*  Message should contain short problem description and (if applicable, for instant you had call / chat with CloudBerry representatives prior submitting) name of that contact from CloudBerry lab.

The above tips drive such ticket to the appropriate person with minimum iterations.

### Command line information

CloudBerry keeps clear structure of such information in the following path: /etc/cloudberry/ as listed below:

The path contains the following information:

*  config - information about account (online account if persistent), product settings;
*  plans - directory with structured plans configuration (each plan is XML structured file with settings for backup / restore plan);
*  log - most important directory for troubleshooting and debugging (when requesting support assistance).
