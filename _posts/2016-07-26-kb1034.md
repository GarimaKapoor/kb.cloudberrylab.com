## Problem

IAM policy does not have enough permissions to access buckets or create new bucket.

## Resolution

You can assign S3 full access policy to your IAM user, but it is better to have granular permissions with only selected policies required for Cloudberry Backup software. Follow the below guide to have your user setup accordingly.

        }
    ]
}

Nota bene!

Please change the "your_bucket_name_goes_here" to your bucket name.
